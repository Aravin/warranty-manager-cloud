Introducing our new application: the Warranty Manager. This powerful tool allows you to easily manage all of your product warranties and related information. Whether you need to save, find, or track household, personal, or business assets, the Warranty Manager has you covered.

With our app, you can save a wide range of information about each product, including the product name, pricing, purchase date, warranty period, warranty start/end date, purchased location, company/brand name, salesperson name, email address and phone number for support, and notes for additional information.

We're always working to improve the app, and upcoming releases will include even more features, such as the ability to indicate whether a product has an international warranty, whether it was purchased online or offline, and the option to save bill copies and additional images.

Our roadmap includes plans to save all images related to each product, including the purchase bill, warranty bill, and additional images, so you can have everything in one convenient location. Additionally, you'll be able to track all service enquiries, repairs, or replacements for each product, making it easy to stay on top of everything.

For seamless access to your data across all devices and environments (mobile, desktop, web, etc.), we offer cloud syncing services.

We're always open to feedback and suggestions, so if you have any feature requests or comments, please let us know. We value your input and strive to address every question and concern. Thank you for choosing the Warranty Manager app!
